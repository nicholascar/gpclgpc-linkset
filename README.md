# GPC / LGPC Linkset
This code repository contains a Linkset - a specialised Dataset linking objects in two other Datasets.

This Linkset contains [SKOS mapping properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#mapping) between Concepts in the [GPC](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/gpc) and Concepts in the [LGPC](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/lgpc) vocabularies.

GPC, "Government Purpose Classification" is an [Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)](https://www.abs.gov.au) a vocabulary of classifiers for use in the collection, analysis and dissemination of local government finance statistics in Australia. It is online as a webpage as the [Revised Government Purpose Classification 2006](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/5514.0.55.001Appendix92005).

LGPC, "Local Government Purpose Classification" is an [Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)](https://www.abs.gov.au) a vocabulary of classifiers for use in the collection, analysis and dissemination of local government finance statistics in Australia. It is online as a webpage as the [Local Government Purpose Classification, 2008](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/5514.0.55.0022008).

The original LGPC document publication, linked to immediately above, contains the correspondence information used for this Linkset.


## Linkset relations
This Linkset uses only [SKOS Mapping Properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#mapping) to map between AGIFT & COFOG-A. Only the following properties are used:

* `skos:exactMatch`
* `skos:broadMatch`
* `skos:narrowMatch`


## Repository Contents
This repository contains the following files and folders:

* [README.md](README.md) - this file
* [resources/](resources/) - background information: the GPC & LGPC vocabularies as RDF (turtle) files as well as the original LGCP document publication which contains the correspondence information used for this Linkset
* [header.ttl](header.ttl) - this Linksetâ€™s data.ttl header information, stored separately for ease of access
* [example-data.ttl](example-data.ttl) - this Linkset's links as an RDF (turtle) file
* [example-data-unreified.ttl](example-data-unreified.ttl) - the Linkset's links as triples, unreified
* [data.ttl](data.ttl) - this Linkset's links as an RDF (turtle) file
* [data-unreified.ttl](data-unreified.ttl) - the Linkset's links as triples, unreified
* [methods/](methods/) - a folder containing the interim correspondences.xlsx file used for correspondence transpcription from the LGPC PDF document and a Python script to turn data-flat.ttl into data.ttl
